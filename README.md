# PureEdgeSim: A simulation toolkit for performance evaluation of fog and pure edge computing environments.
## New version 1.1
## Changelog  
* Added support for registry and containers

* Improved the network model: 

  Adding support for containers,bugs fixing, 
  
  Adding fog servers coverage, 
  
  Adding edge  wireless range.

* Improved mobility model

  More realistic mobility model
  
  Added a map/ simulation area (height x width)
  
* Adding support for physical depolyement of the orchestrator 

  Deploying the orchestrator on the cloud for example, on fog servers...etc
  
* New simulation parameters

  New parameters for the aforementioned changes
  
  New simulation parameters in order to control the trade off between simulation accuracy and simulation time, etc. 
  
* Improved simulation time
