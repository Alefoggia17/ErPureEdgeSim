## Changelog
## New version 2.1.0 (oct 31th 2019)
* The code has been improved  
* Fixed some minor bugs 

## New version 2.0.0 (oct 24th 2019)
* The code has been revisited and cleaned, now it is more readable  
* New mobility model and new parameters for mobility update 
  Now it uses speed in m/s instead of intervals
  The new mobility model works on demand, instead of generating a list for each device containing all its location changes (from the beginning of the simulation). 
  The egde devices will request the next location only when needed (which reduces the use of memory)
* New and more realistic energy model and new energy parameters 
* Added initialization time to simulation parameters (in order to ignore the time when the resources are being generated)
* Some bugs here and there has been fixed 
* Added ram as a propoerty to EdgeDataCenter class
* Added real time simulation map (now you can verify and check how your mobility model is working)  
* Added some real time charts 
  Showing the CPU utilization of Cloud, Fog and Edge resources, the WAN utilization, and the tasks success rate
* Adding the possibility to generate charts at the end of the simulation and to save them in a *.PNG format 
  More than 64 high resolution charts can be generated with one click, in order to make it easier for the user to check his simlation results
  The user can always generate other charts using the generated CSV file.
* Adding new simulation parameters regarding charts (displaying them, the refresh delay, saving them..)

  New parameters for the aforementioned changes
  
  New simulation parameters in order to control the trade off between simulation accuracy and simulation time, etc. 
  
* Improved simulation time
